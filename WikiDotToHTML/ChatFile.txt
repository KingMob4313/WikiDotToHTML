Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Hihi.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Hallos!##
Kai_Tukov##110481|		And... TACOS!##
Guylian:	##336633|		For everybody!##
YaraST:	##666666|		Oh, no tacos for me. I'm full. How were manatees?##
Guylian:	##336633|		Fantastic! Definitely something you need to put on your list if you ever come down this way##
YaraST:	##666666|		Hee, they just look so blorbular and... Dunno if cuddly so much as squidgy. Are they particularly smart?##
Guylian:	##336633|		Its pretty much all muscles (and no, it's not that kind of excuse *L*). Only about 30% is body fat which is why they need to stick to the warm springs in the winter. Their faces are 'cuddly' in that Sharpei kind of way, their bodies aren't squishy but solid torpedos. They surprised me with how quick they can be if they want to.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Neat! They only LOOK like water marshmallows, then.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Eeep, I'd be scared.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Yup! And they maneuver pretty expertly in the water too. And while they are most of the time sedate, swimming next to a 500 pound water animal is rather impressive *grins* good thing they aren't known for ripping your arms off##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Sheeesh, that's is pretty weird, but neat. Didn't know there were warm springs there.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		~keeps checking for Chad~##
YaraST:	##666666|		And there are mermaids, too!##
Guylian:	##336633|		72F all year 'round *nods* I've only known cold springs until now. You can go tubing on the Ichetucknee starting by the spring and, boy, is it ever cold!##
Guylian:	##336633|		The cool thing about the springs is that the water is absolutely crystal clear. It's amazing##
Guylian:	##336633|		http://www.ichetucknee-tube-center.com/##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		~goes to check~ .. Mermaids?##
YaraST:	##666666|		http://weekiwachee.com/home.html##
Guylian:	##336633|		Yep, Weeki Wachi Springs##
YaraST:	##666666|		I would not want to do that job, nifty springs or not~##
Guylian:	##336633|		Heh ...me neither##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		OMG!##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		##
YaraST:	##666666|		~choooomp!~##
Guylian:	##336633|		Nothing is cuter than Mama-tees with their babies *nodnod*##
Guylian:	##336633|		There, your lady-love is sold Next thing she'll be checking flights##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		So heyew-mid.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Heh. Watch me find the only gator in the rivier.##
YaraST:	##666666|		... River. Nerp. Was only a pint and a half, sheesh.##
Guylian:	##336633|		No gators in the springs##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		I can wrestle pretty good, but don't know about gator wrestling##
YaraST:	##666666|		It looks very nifty. And certainly warm. Man, can't wait for spring.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Definitely nothing you wanna do in the water##
Guylian:	##336633|		Amen! Spring needs to get here stat!##
YaraST:	##666666|		Bleeeerg. Was in Philadelphia with my mother last weekend. Was warm(er)... No snow... Went to a garden show, and it was full of plants we can't grow here. ~L~##
Guylian:	##336633|		I have a banana plant in my backyard *grins* Me! A banana tree! *chuckles* Never thought I'd be living in a place where you can do that. Although right now it's not a happy banana - too many frosty days made it look worse for wear ... it's working on a new green leaf though##
YaraST:	##666666|		BANANA! ... Ahem. I mean, oh, spiffy!##
Guylian:	##336633|		It's CRAZY! And I just imagined your voice sounding like on of Dru's minions ....heh##
YaraST:	##666666|		~chortle~ I remember seeing bananas in England and thinking that was crazy enough. But to have banana or citrus in the backyard, man, that'd be really cool.##
Guylian:	##336633|		You can keep'em in a pot! Citrus that is. Put them outside when it's warm and sunny and keep them by the window and the heater the rest of the year##
YaraST:	##666666|		Aaaand see them devoured by cats.##
YaraST:	##666666|		We have enough trouble keeping a hot pepper alive. ~groans~ They chew on it, hork... And go back for more.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		dammit.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Okay, messaging Chad, maybe I should hit his phone.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Weeeird##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Yeah, well we can start in 10 maybe without, he got pulled away by something.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Weird cats ...ours act more like dogs##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Lucky you. The new one acts like a meth addict.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Can do... Mostly just background for ST stuff for a bit.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Well, Binky wakes up at 5:30am ...##
YaraST:	##666666|		Awwww, Binky!##
Guylian:	##336633|		We've never mastered the art of picking cool, clever, sophisticated names for our cats ... ahem##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		I can't sling any stones.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Had Kai and now Dmitri.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Ahem ... Boots, Blop (passed away a couple of years ago), Buttons (passed away last spring), and Binky ... we apparently have a thing for names starting with 'B'##
YaraST:	##666666|		Time for Bananaramabananaramadingdong!##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Next will have to be 'burrito' and ...##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Okay, you just trumped me, C.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*LOL*##
YaraST:	##666666|		Eventually to be known only as "Ding".##
YaraST:	##666666|		"Dong" just... No.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Oh, little Dingy. He was so cute.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Heh##
YaraST:	##666666|		So, yeah... ~looks around~ Should we start with something? Blast from the past, back to the club... Random shenanigans?##
Guylian:	##336633|		*flashes fangs* Rrrrrrandom shenanigans sounds lovely##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		eep! ~hides~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Well, random shenanigans. We'll need to frame something.##
Guylian:	##336633|		C'mere ... *purrs* lets play##
YaraST:	##666666|		This is where you need a jar of titles... "The night of the flamingo... ON ICE!"##
Guylian:	##336633|		*chuckles* or locations ... G terrorizing K at (insert location)##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Po' Somchai.##
YaraST:	##666666|		S'troo... I can NPC for the range..?##
YaraST:	##666666|		Ooooooor there's Heyhey##
YaraST:	##666666|		at the range.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Still NPC, but not a range NPC. Heh##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Never mind, Po' Heyhey.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Hmmrrr? You know, you could play Yara ... G hasn't met her yet. I dunno, might be a good opportunity to get the chicks to meet##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Ooh, and I could ST. Could have their meeting happen before this.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		We could also just say Damian is called over by the prince to discuss something (we all know that Damian has done enough stupid shit for the prince to want to talk to him) leaving Kai and Guylian to catch up.##
Guylian:	##336633|		and keep C. story going ... yup##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Let's keep it going then.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Happy to keep that going, and if Chad shows up, he can just jump in... But I do look forward to the night the ladies meet. Mwahaha.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Yeah, we can have them talk about cars *sporfle*##
YaraST:	##666666|		Can get K & G's story straight for what happened in their past. ~cacklecackle~##
YaraST:	##666666|		So... Need a refresher on what the club looks like?##
Guylian:	##336633|		Like anybody knows ... heh##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Let's keep this going. I know what the club looks like (beautiful club that I'm too old to be in now) but repost please.##
YaraST:	##666666|		http://www.palms.com/wp-content/themes/palms/lib/timthumb.php?src=http://www.palms.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nightlife2.jpg&w=589&h=328&zc=1&de=0http://miburl.com/uz482W##
YaraST:	##666666|		STly: ~a club on the 55th floor, reserved for the night... A glass floor that permits a view all the way down to the pool, out on the open-air balcony, and knots of kindred chatting, with one eye on the door~##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Like the ol' Bhagwan club i Duesseldorf ...heh)##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Heh, neat}}##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Okies, so...##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		IC:##

----

Guylian:	##336633|		*She keeps her arm casually looped through Kai's as Damian splits from the group to heed the Prince's call. To her surprise , she welcomed the sight of two familiar faces - no matter how tangled their stories are - in a sea of toothy unfamiliar sharks, moments shy of feeding frenzy.##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Obviously need to straighten out my grammar and tenses tonight ... sheesh]##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai follows her, watching Damian split from the two, raising a brow as he gets lead.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Is cool, I'm so rusty that I might have problems managing things such as sentence subject and verbs. Yay, 1 year of latin and I'm ruined for life\##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		]]##
YaraST:	##666666|		~must be important; but then, with all the luminaries of the Domain scattered about, who wants to listen to a cellphone bleep and whine?~##
YaraST:	##666666|		~it's quieter out on the balcony--some of the more secretive types might not like a location so open. Or high up. Or transparent.~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"It's been half of forever..." Kai begins, tentatively not sure of where this is going. "Surprised to see you here, to say the least."##
Guylian:	##336633|		Hmmmrr.... *She tips her head, a riot of curls following the small movement to conceal her face." I'm not sure you are what the doctor ordered ...*Him? Damian? or both?* but I'm here on .... vacation. Doctor's orders. *Amber eyes peer at him from underneath dark lashes, their golden glow the only thing breaking the darkness about her." Didn't expect to see##
Guylian:	##336633|		you here either, but it's good seeing you.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Hi!##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Wheeeeee! *pounce*]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		*Was ready for it... So only dislocated a hip*##
YaraST:	##666666|		((Huzzah! We had just gotten things rolling, hoping you'd appear, and lo, the incantation worked!))##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Had trouble getting set up for the night. Bain was melting down hard enough that he needed his Dad to calm him down.##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Aww ... poor baby]##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He shrugs his broad shoulders, trying to play nonchalant. "If I'm what your doctor ordered, then you have a very cruel doctor." He repostés, trying to sell some enthusiasm into his voice as he does, sliding his gaze away from hers as she looks up, as if he was hiding something in them.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Spring break is hard on the kid. He's exceptionally schedule-driven.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Ahem... somewhat UNlike his dad.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Damn, I'm sorry to hear that, he going to be okay? ]]##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Shit happens, broceph. Is all good. I just figured you were rolling on hood-time]]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Yeah. He'll be fine. He just doen't like to not know what's going on and what's expected.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((We still in the bar?}}##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Yep, and D is having a chat with the Prince]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		(OH... Lovely.))##
YaraST:	##666666|		((Needs a break-schedule, huh? Poor guy. How long is the break? And yep, we're picking right up from last time, at the bar, with the boys just having met up... D "stepped away to take a call", but we barely got into things.))##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((One week. Almost done.))##
YaraST:	##666666|		((Let's just mulligan that, and say D's back with the others, heading out to the balcony.))##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Okaydokay]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((*Puts on Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory and grabs color*))##
Guylian:	##336633|		*There is a moment's pause, just long enough to be noticeable.* There's very little that isn't ...##
YaraST:	##666666|		((Again, the joint: http://www.palms.com/nightlife/las-vegas-ghostbar/))##
Guylian:	##336633|		[I'd die a thousand deaths on that balcony *LOL*]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D rolls his shoulders as he heads back out to the dizzying heights of the open-air deck. The Prince is just so... normal. So... polite. 'That guy creeps me out,' he decides, though carefully keeping it to himself.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Her words draw a small wince from him and he leads her to stop at the railing, the city a spilled cask of jewels before them. "Including me, evidently..." Apologizing, he offers a wan, thin lipped smile to her. "I'm not being very friendly."##
YaraST:	##666666|		~who knows what the Prince thinks of D... His attention is on the Ventrue Primogen who is savagely chewing on the end of his cigar. He's got that button pushed, all right...~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		The lanky Gangrel looks first up, then around the deck, his his head tilting oddly as his eyes shift; a decidedly avian motion.  D rolls his shoulders as he heads back out to the dizzying heights of the open-air deck. The Prince is just so... normal. So... polite. 'That guy creeps me out,' he decides, though carefully keeping it to himself.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Her words draw a small wince from him and he leads her to stop at the railing, the city a spilled cask of jewels before them. "Including me, evidently..." Apologizing, he offers a wan, thin lipped smile to her. "I'm not being very friendly."##
YaraST:	##666666|		~who knows what the Prince thinks of D... His attention is on the Ventrue Primogen who is savagely chewing on the end of his cigar. He's got that button pushed, all right...~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		The lanky Gangrel looks first up, then around the deck, his his head tilting oddly as his eyes shift; a decidedly avian motion.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D draws up short, keeping a respectful distance, noting that Kai has allowed... Nora... to stand closer to him than most he talks to. He considers Kai's slightly hunched posture, and watches for the thumb brushing the side of his nose.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Almost on cue, he tips his head, tobacco dark eyes flitting to Damian for a moment as he taps his nose with a knuckle. Maybe D can rescue him from his awkwardness.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He wanders toward the rail, his mind turning like a sour stomach with all the other people from his past. Worry and guilt churn in his gut, keeping time with the revolutions of his mind. Too many damn questions, and how many of the lines end at me?##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D glances up at Kai's tell, and barely contains a smirk. He sidles toward the pair of Gangrel in no particular hurry.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She untangles their arms, bracing herself against the railing and raising on her toes, for a better look at the glittering city lights to their feet or to take flight, who knows. Bursts of wind rake through her hair, the ribbon du jour losing the nightly battle with those springy locks.* There might be time to make it up ...##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Time to put that aside, until I finally decide to fucking do something about it, he concludes, shoving a stubborn stick of will into the bike spokes of his runaway mind.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Heh." D chuckles at Nora's words, a short sharp sound of wry amusement.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Well, if you're not dealing with some sort of.. " He draws the words out with a rumble... Searching for it. "Debt to be paid. I know neither of us walked from that city unscathed."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Making it up as we go along, more like, he smirks to himself. He looks at Kai as he speaks and the smile turns somber. We are never, ever unscathed, are we?##
YaraST:	##666666|		~the chatter abruptly hushes... A curious little scene plays out by the Prince. A tweedy man has presented himself to the Giovanni, and the Toreador around the primogen of their clan by the bar are intently watching. Mr. Veddy Proper pays them no mind~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"That was quic-" He's cut short as his words grow loud over the fading din of conversation about them. He follows the focus of attention to the prince.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He schools his face to a pleasant mask (or at least what passes for pleasant on D's harshly angled features) and leans nonchalantly against the rail.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~his presentation is no slower than Guyli's, and he is gone just as quickly. The Roses' conversation takes a while to start again, and only after Lady Remington initiates it~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D glances over his shoulder at the Next Big Thing. Flash in the pan is more like, if he's got the Torries' attention...##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D glances again at Lady Remington and blanches. He turns resolutely toward the rail, the pleasant gone, and the brooding returning from its smoke break. Brooding probably looked more natural on him anyway...##
Guylian:	##336633|		*The petite Gangrel coughs up a wry laugh, but otherwise remains silent, the growing silence burning in her ears.*##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Narrowing his dark eyes, the feline slit that hasn't faded in over three years widening as he does, taking in the newcomer. The conversation was terse before and now it just faceplanted like a stone drunk Irishman.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~laughter strikes up again, but it is brittle, hastily trying to smooth over wrinkles from the newcomer's passing~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Know'im, Kai?"##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D inclines his head toward the newcomer.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He shakes his head, hair getting pushed about his face from the rising breeze, forcing him to fight against the barely shoulder length mass. "He's new to me."##
Guylian:	##336633|		Clearly somebody you shouldn't be hanging out with ... *She murmurs quietly, watching D and K from the corner of her eyes.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Hm," he says noncommittally. Like as not, he thinks, Kai's got a few territory issues. New buck on the hill. Mentally, he gives a shrug. Kai'll knock him off the hill or establish the pecking order soon enough.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Or she meant me, both work. It's a funny, story, you know." Kai begins, as he pushes the hair back behind his ears. "But probably not as interesting as how you two know each other."##
Guylian:	##336633|		Puttin' on that suit again ...? *Her amber eyes narrow to twinkling slits at D, her hand sliding up to tuck a stray lock behind her ear.*##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Call us the Bobsy Twins!]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		The Lanky gangrel doesn't blush, and can't, it seems... but he doesn't need to. His eyes fall to the floor, and his posture shifts almost defensively, bashfully.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~One of the Torries, Alicia, glances between her group and Kai's, a thoughtful expression growing~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He recovers quickly, but if he had to recover, that slip would be remembered for decades to come.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~some of the regular Elysium-goers are drifting to more comfortable seating... Some of the less-seen members are making for the elevator to leave~##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She turns around, her back to the dark glittering abyss behind her, and casually leans against the railing casually observing the crowd and their antics. She wishes for a drink, something to give her hands something to do, and fights the urge to simply jam them into the pockets of her jacket.* He wasn't much fun ....then *she muses, adding to Kai's half-told##
Guylian:	##336633|		story.* We got to hang out fer a bit in ... *she pauses a moment, searching Kai's face for approval.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D spreads his hands, almost apologetically. "I was young. Angry. Confused."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		His hawklike eyes sparkle with a mischievous humor. Wisecracks? From Damian frigging Stark? Perish the thought!##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Catching the sheepish pose of Damian, he coughs. "Damn, didn't mean it like that, man. Or maybe I did and I'm a huge douche because of it." His words take up to a canter before he reals it back in, closing his eyes. There's a nervous laugh.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He looks to Guylian, still not knowing what to call her. "It's okay, I assume things didn't go too badly for you after the twin cities?"##
YaraST:	##666666|		~even the Prince rises, and with a short bow to the assembly, takes himself off, a retinue peeling itself away from various corners and niches to form up behind him; the sheriff leads the way~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Honestly, if it was interesting, " he points to Nora (though its more like a shadowy Cousin It in the wind) "It was because of her."##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Shit." He curses, under his breath, watching the prince leave. What in hell is going on that has everyone this spooked?##
Guylian:	##336633|		Any bomb threats lately ...? *She frowns, watching the exit strategy taking place.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Nah," D quips. "Cruise missile. We're in the 21st, after all."##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Not sure, I've been keeping shit on the downlow..." He nods to Damian. "You heard anything?"##
Guylian:	##336633|		Too much collateral damage ... *G muses.* Is this how you break up parties here or ...?##
YaraST:	##666666|		~with the Prince gone, and whatever excitement was earlier, the mood seems to shift, as if the room had been holding its breath, and only now released it. Looking about the room, some kindred paid none of this any mind at all... For those more attuned to the Beast, the edgy nerves of some were more readily apparent. The last look of the Prince's face, however##
YaraST:	##666666|		as the elevator doors closed... Vicious amusement, with a hint of smug... That was not a kind smile that disappeared behind those steel doors~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Mind keeps going back to Li Bu and that lot." he frowns, his freakish eyes narrowed. "Somethin' still naggin'at me 'bout that whole clusterfuck."##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Mutherfucking hackles..." Again, hissed through clenched teeth. "Anyone up for a walk?"##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D goes stock-still. His eyes remain narrow, and he stares blankly at the doors to the elevator for a moment.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Let's go ... *Catching that cruel sneer on the Prince's face, she decides that the air is getting too thick to breathe in here.*##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He speaks aloud, less a question and more of a shrouded command.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D blinks, coming back from wherever he had been for a second.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~Alicia, however, notices their group trying to settle their ruffled feathers, and takes this as her moment to approach. She definitely doesn't try to sneak, not that someone that Rubinesque can manage it well in those heels. She has the beauty of another era. Now, most would just call her "kinda fat"~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He nods slowly, sniffing the air. His lip curls slightly with some sort of instinct. By the hunch of his shoulders, it was one of those hairs-stand-on-end, Tears-of-Cassandra sorts of instincts.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D's eyes snap to Kai, his gaze intense. Is she a threat? Or no? He watches for Kai's reaction to her, following his lead-- hell, ANY lead-- for a change.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai moves to greet Alicia, thinning the choleric look on his face a bit with a forced smile. "Alicia, good to see you again. Sorry I thought you were busy..."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D visibly relaxes his shoulders, but a fine tension remains behind, like ship's rigging still held taut in anticipation of a gale.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~Alicia smiles, offering her hand to shake to Kai, and to the others, if they'll take it~ Yes, there was a little bit of business to take care of. But! ~she says cheerily, a smile breaking out across her rosy-cheeked face~ Now it's settled, and on to new business. You said you were looking for some work? If you can convince your friends to help...##
YaraST:	##666666|		I think we can play ball, here.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Blinking, he shakes her hand, thrown of his cadence. "I..." Shifting his weight back as he releases the shake small bow, out of habit. "...can't speak for them, but I'm all ears."##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She tips her head in a polite greeting at the newcomer, forcing a polite smile onto her face as well. Example citizen, she reminds herself inwardly, forcing the tension vibrating through her small form down to a low buzz.*##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Sorry, mibbit being weird, I posted but it didn't show.]]##
YaraST:	##666666|		~Alicia's dark hair is loosely swept up--it could have taken her five minutes in front of the mirror, or an hour at the salon... Her suit fits her to perfection, and her vibe is more Ventrue than Rose as she gives D and G frank, appraising looks, like horses at auction. Better not smile, or she may just try checking teeth~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D arches his brow and considers Alicia stoically for a few moments, his yellow eyes appraising.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D makes a point of meeting her eyes, memorizing their shape, hue, unintentionally putting forth the demeanor of one predator staring down another.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~maybe she once sold used cars--she takes Damian's look, and her smile just beams all the wider, like that was just what she wanted to see~ Oh, that's just beautiful.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai stands between his two clan brethren and the corralling Rose, watching his contact take the measure of the other two.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Recognizing the smile, he groans. "We're just about to take a spin around the city, so can you tell me what you're proposing, Alicia?" He asks, pushing the name out there, so the other two know.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*G seems perfectly happy to just observe and listen.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		A Rose... By any other name, it'd still have thorns. Dangerous, one-man (woman) cults of personality, capable of beauty and horror. They are not to be snubbed, but not to be trusted. One, perhaps, but this is not she. Listen, respect, and perhaps admire. Never, ever to be underestimated.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((We. Are. So. On tonight... Just saying.))##
YaraST:	##666666|		Well, it's not really my business, but the Lady's. ~she demurs, taking a step to the side, and indicating the Primogen, towering over the flock surrounding her. She's playing to her courtiers, that much is obvious, but from under her lashes, a surreptitious glance, a lingering stare... Alicia and the Gangrel have her attention~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Realization dawns on D's angular face and his head droops. He facepalms, right out there in front of God and everyone. "Alright, then," he growls to Alicia, though his eyes never leave Remington. "It's like that. Make yer pitch. I'm listenin'##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He mutters, likely to himself. "Laugh it up Holt. Hope yer enjoyin' whatever hell yer in tonight."##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Shall we?" He inquires of the other two, the juxtaposition of Guylian and Damian's radically different forms suddenly seeming comical.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*It's now obvious this job offer has most likely nothing to do with music ... unless K has changed beats in the past couple of years. She fights hard to keep her face noncommittal and politely blank, but her hands seek out the depths of her jacket's pockets.*##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Gangrels come in all sizes and colors and can match your lifestyle! Get your Gangrel today!]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((ROFLCOPTER))##
YaraST:	##666666|		FanTAStic! ~she chirps, leading the parade towards the primogen like a cheery cruise director. Is it possible her smile got wider? That's an unsettling number of teeth visible~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[I can just hear that in my head.. Fan TAAAAAH Stick!]]##
Guylian:	##336633|		*G trails behind, still expecting the club, something or maybe somebody to blow up any moment. Then again, final death would be much nicer than what these Roses could have in mind ... jobwise. As far as debts go, she and Kai should be even by now. Maybe she would even come out ahead ... *##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Damian openly scowls at Alicia's back. Just like a motherfucking Rose to treat any assent as an open invitation to grab a guy by the balls. Torries in the past have had faces ripped off for less arrogance than this. D's level of wary hostility rises another notch.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((At least she didn't flip her hand limp[y and squeal, "Faaa-bu-louus!"))##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Don't forget to add "Daaah-lings" at the end ]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((That's more elegant than I'm giving these particular queens credit for.))##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai doesn't seem to be concerned, but Damian has seen him sliding amongst the roses with nary a thorn scraping his proverbial whiskers. Follows a polite two steps behind the curvy Alicia, smile now crooked.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((Jeezus f-ing christ. I'm even OOCing like D...))##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Lady Remington is a classy lady, mind you. ~cackles~]]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((Point. I'll give you that one. Holt tried to be ... her.))##
YaraST:	##666666|		~the chatter around the Lady tapers off as the quartet join the group (at varying distances depending on their comfort level). Remington condescends to seat herself at a barstool, knocking a good foot off her height. In a surprisingly low voice for those who don't know her, she greets them~ So good of you, so good. Thank you for joining me.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D sniffs the air and immediately wishes he hadn't. So much goddamned perfume and cologne hanging in the air, it's like a fucking Chanel factory in here. I could just flip a damn table.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He eyes the table, a dangerous glint in his eye... as though he's saving that back as a 'Plan C'.##
YaraST:	##666666|		(( (?°?°)?? ??? ))##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D stalks up to stand before Remington, close enough that if the shotgun weren't proverbial, it'd be pressed against his pants zipper. Between the Lady and his friends...##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((*snicker*))##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai again runs interference, feeling the fight-or-flight tension building from behind him from Damian. The Lady's basso roll to her words probably has Guylian, at least, back in her heels. It is rather shocking.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Hmmm... ~Damian's proximity gets an appreciative look. A long-fingered hand with beautifully manicured nails almost... almost... dares a touch, but refrains at just the last moment~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		{[recind]]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D bares his teeth with a baleful stare at Remington. "Get on with it, Rose. What do you want?"##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Kai moves to interject, touching Damian's shoulder. "Dee, let's not get up between friends here..." Kai slides out there. "No need for big business."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He glances at Kai, taking the hint. He relaxes a bit and makes to step back, growling out, "I'm just pissed because her voice is deeper'n mine."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He gives Remington a wink and a wolfish grin as he steps away, letting Kai head the negotiations.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*The Ventrue have taught the dainty Gangrel well - everything about 'Lady' Remington is filed away, scent, voice, appearance and body language - behind the impeccable facade of a polite smile curving those dusky rose tinted lips and just a hint of amusement over D's dominance display. She is sure the Lady's appetites are varied and voracious.*##
YaraST:	##666666|		~fellow Roses hiss in displeasure, muttering amongst themselves. The Lady gives him an affronted look, before lowering the tone of her compatriots by letting out a laugh, head thrown back, and Adam's apple obvious~ Oh my, edge performances tonight, is it? And I wasn't even after a show.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Like a fight promoter, he tries to get a foot in between the two, looking a little flustered at Damian peels off. "...My apologies, lady. What's the night without a little drama then? If you'd like, I could do some soft-shoe for you, after that." He deadpans, eyes heavy on Damian before he shakes it off.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		But he does not touch Remington during the tete-a-tete.##
YaraST:	##666666|		No, no, I've not heard of your talents in that area, unless you've been holding out on your friends. ~she winsomely smiles, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees~ No, what I need from you is some company. Not for me, I should say, but for someone just arrived.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Oh, as some in your clan know, I'm full of surprises." He jokes. "Tourism or entertainment?"##
YaraST:	##666666|		You, and your colleagues. ~she adds, looking between the three of them~ Entertainment, tourism... ~she turns solemn~ Security...##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Damian frowns slightly... The newcomer. This is such a fucking set-up.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*Things are about to get really interesting considering how the 'newcomer' set everybody on edge ....and especially the three clan mates.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He sweeps his gaze over the table full of Roses he's managed to offend (good going, D. Really top-notch.) Hissing like the pile of snakes they are, they've shown their stripes. If I can be a better dancer than they expect, the fangs and venom won't be a problem.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D sets up mentally for the dance. Painting Remington with the same brush as Holt might be a mistake, but their demeanors are so damn alike. She could be Holt reincarnated.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~when the Lady laughed, the Roses backed off. The pack leader here is more than obvious. The Lady's blonde curls are quickly swept back as she straightens, giving them an expectant look~ I would be very appreciative. It will make the performance I've taken the trouble to sponsor... Well, I would feel more confident in its success with some assitance.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"I can get them into all the best clubs, and bounce those who get in the way." He states flatly. "Not sure if my friends are willing to not play hardass any longer or..."##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She waits for Kai's lead on this dance floor, remembering too well the admonishments of her Prince ... - keep a low profile for a while ... take a vacation... - wishful thinking.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D looks at Guylian meaningfully, though he can't imagine she knows what he's thinking.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[ 'Take a vacation' Bwahahaha ~not-exactly sane laughter~ Like that's going to work out. ]]##
YaraST:	##666666|		Oh no! No, he'd not be going to any clubs! ~She looks positively shocked~ He has to prepare. Perhaps a walk about town. ~she gestures vaguely~ Light conversation.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D shrugs. "Done security and the like before. Worked for Sheriff Holt in Seattle for over a year."##
Guylian:	##336633|		[Babysitting ..how hard can it be ...riiiiiiiight ]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((Watch Adventures in Babysitting recently? Nuff said.))##
DamianStark:	##800000|		He gives a level look at Remington, glancing at the table, wondering if any of the Roses remember the flamboyant Brujah Sheriff... Probably not, but one name drop will raise questions...##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		There's never a reason to ask why. "I understand." He says to re-assure her, his jokes flying over the head of the Primogen. Things are starting to piece together, now. \##
Guylian:	##336633|		*Slanted amber eyes catch D's meaningful look Run off? Now? With him? That's a trick question, isn't it? Instead here they are, stuck in the Elysium's political morass.*##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Just a bit of a sight-seeing trip, some leash holding, some interference."##
YaraST:	##666666|		~Kai's rewarded with a smile, and Alicia swoops in again to herd them off~ Won't you just come with me, and we can get all the details pinned down?##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D unconsciously straightens, putting on his business-face. He follows Kai... a weird feeling.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He follows after Alicia, tension returning to his frame as they move away. Well that was a half-disaster.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Feeling like Damian has trampled his way through a garden he was tending, he can't help but grumble. He'll have to get that sorted out.##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Get off my lawn! *L*)##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She follows her clanmates and Alicia, hoping that one of the details they need to nail down is that their charge is so not a lunatic. Of course, there is still time to throw oneself off the balcony...*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		I fucking hate this shit. Damian keeps his face neutral, his manner frosty, as he follows. Inside, his irritation and anger roiling in his belly. The butterflies are suiting up, this time with blowtorches.##
YaraST:	##666666|		~Alicia leads them to a comfortable set of white chairs, and settles in, ankles primly crossed~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"So... We good or am I just on this solo?" He asks of Guylian and Damian, brow quirked.##
Guylian:	##336633|		's all copacetic ....*She brushes past Kai, sliding into a seat with the boneless languid grace of a cat descending onto her favorite perch.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D stares at Kai. "Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?" He speaks quietly, but urgently. "This whole thing stinks. It's a set-up from the word go... all the way from the Li Bu thing to my last trip to the airport." He glances again at Guylian. "I won't let you burn like that. Not alone."##
YaraST:	##666666|		~she looks around the three, bemused, and not bothering to hide it. While she may not quite get why the tension, the muttering, the tense looks... Hard to miss, even if not the perceptive type. Lady Remington returns to lording it over her flock~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He blinks at Damian, once then again then shrugs at Alicia. "So, whats the setlist look like?"##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Neither of you." He takes a seat and folds his hands in his lap, his attention on Alicia.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Drumming his fingers against his leg, he waits for Damian to spin out some of that tension, waiting for Alicia to answer.##
YaraST:	##666666|		For tonight, nothing at all, but tomorrow, if you could please get to the Smith Centre, before the show. ~she asks~ Just go to the box office, and we'll have tickets sorted, if you want to catch the first act.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Damian sits and... breathes. For a time, he had forgotten Ujie, but tonight's proceedings brought a lot of his past roaring back. He picks out the most useful part of that past to use here. And he breathes. Pushing out the clouds of anger and irritation, the feeling that other people have him (and worse, his friends) over a barrel and leaving just clarity.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		In theory, anyway.##
Guylian:	##336633|		A blind date? *Guylian inquires politely, a brow darting up to a questioning arch over slanted eyes, a seemingly amused smile ghosting on her face.* Or does he have a name?##
DamianStark:	##800000|		And Guylian asks his question for him. Patience. Temperance. Focus.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Three tickets, I'll be in my best, I assure you. I'll need details of the hand-off, interface between the team there and my crew here." Kai rattles off quickly, searching for a pen again in his pocket. "What made you decide we were the ones for this? If this is someone's idea of a joke, or a patsy-stamp..."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D nods slowly. I owe that man an apology. I should have trusted him to begin with. This is his show. He lashes himself with his own thought, something about people getting faces ripped off for arrogance.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Vincent. ~she says after a pause, and a quick glance in the direction of Lady Remington~ He'll be rather busy. You'll have to find him during the entr'acte... ~she draws up short as Kai channels his inner officer~ Well, Jean isn't going to be upset if Gangrel keep an eye on Vincent. Nor will with Lady, of course. Besides... ~she leans closer to Kai, and...##
YaraST:	##666666|		sets a hand on the arm of his chair~ We all trust you, dear. You've been very dependable, and we know you are an excellent judge of character.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		I can blame the irritation. I can blame the fear. I can blame the confusion, but they are all mine. I could blame these other sonso'bitches, but they didn't make my choices for me. They ain't THAT good at this.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		I hope.##
YaraST:	##666666|		And you know how we Toreador talk. ~she smiles again. Talk to who? Who have they been talking to? Who might they talk to... Someone with red hair, perhaps...~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Nods in understanding, showing the purposeful control of an officer taking down an incident report, or a morgue technician reviewing cause of death. "Vincent. During the..." He scribbles some shorthand on a receipt. "Sorry, I shouldn't be so wary, but..." A long sigh. "People have tried to hold the match to be before."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Dammit. But I am most certainly NOT responsible for Anastasia's choices... or her big mouth. He swallows that uncomfortable thought and politely asks the butterflies to use their blowtorches on it.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"It's what you roses don't say, that's the part that's interesting to everyone, including yourselves." He finishes for her.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Watching Damian, he notes his thoughtful look. But turns his attention to Guylian. "You up to seeing a show tomorrow? I won't think they'll be having popcorn, so I guess I'll still owe you."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D's face breaks into a smile at Kai's verbal jibe at Guylian.##
YaraST:	##666666|		It's just a ballet. ~she protests, sounding a little hurt~ Just make sure Vincent's fans don't carry him off, and see him to his engagement afterwards. That's all.##
Guylian:	##336633|		I'll take a rain check *She replies to Kai's banter, unfolding from her comfortable perch and moving into a different, yet equally lounging position.* I've heard a lot about your shows in Vegas##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Sounds easy enough..." Famous last words, Kai.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*There's a tiny twitch at the mentioning of a ballet. Obviously the petite Gangrel is more of a ....carnivore, expecting bare steaks rather than pastries served on lace doilies.*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Unless he's not expecting us, in which case..." He makes a go-team fist and chirps cheerily, "kidnapping charges!"##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((lace doilies... *snorts and falls off chair*))##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		((Bwahahah, lace doilies))##
Guylian:	##336633|		(It's got to be a Malk *nods gravely*##
Guylian:	##336633|		(and Malks are always badnews)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((AGREED.))##
YaraST:	##666666|		Ah, no, Vincent is certainly expecting you. ~she says, with a quick glance at Kai. Funny, what company he keeps...~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Excellent. Do you have a timetable for where and when?"##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"Just safer to know beforehand. Maybe yer above those sort'o' Junior High pranks... But some Kindred think they're hilarious..."##
Guylian:	##336633|		*G stifles a laugh - kidnapping charges - right. Vincent, the Ballerina, would probably die of a heart attack ...She watches Alicia across steepled fingers* Why the concern for his safety?##
YaraST:	##666666|		The show starts at eight, and you just need to be there by curtain. ~she assures them. Guyli's question makes her pause, but with another quick glance at Lady Remington, she continues~ A great deal of money has been spent on convincing Jean to bring the production here. Vincent has been given a large role, and some of the other dancers, well...##
YaraST:	##666666|		Surely you heard what happened with the Bolshoi recently... ~she trails off~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"The Bol..." It takes a moment to register. "...Oh, yes. The acid attack."##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Damian takes on an expression of distaste.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Who is his security detail on the inside ... *G inquires politely.* ..during rehearsals?##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He nods to Guylian, knowing that she's worked as a guardian of sorts herself, happy she's restating an earlier question.##
YaraST:	##666666|		Well, the other dancers are only going to be told tomorrow. Before curtain. ~she delicately supplies after another quick glance the Lady's way~ To minimize the hazard, you understand.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		The cards are slowly being put on the table, reluctantly it seems. "I understand..."##
Guylian:	##336633|		Might be too late then ... *Guylian muses* if we get there by curtain...##
Guylian:	##336633|		Since obviously you are concerned about serious repercussions a day before the news break ... *She tips her head, slanted eyes narrowing at Alicia.*##
YaraST:	##666666|		Jean will be delivering the news. ~she muses~ But, if you want to be backstage, I suppose there's no harm. The Lady was concerned you might upset the dancers. ~here, not a glance at the Lady, but one at Damian...~##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Damian gives her his best innocent smile.##
Guylian:	##336633|		(*LOL*)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		How good it is is anyone's guess.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		"I won't call anyone cupcake. I promise."##
YaraST:	##666666|		I'm sure most would be flattered. ~she says, pulling herself to her feet~ I'll see you tomorrow at the box-office. If you'll excuse me, I have scads of fires to put out tonight. You have my number. ~she says to Kai~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He pushes himself to his feet, looking to his other two clan mates, wondering. "I have your phone number, I'll see you at the box-office. I may need to change this plan on the fly, so I'll let you know tomorrow the scenario."##
YaraST:	##666666|		Don't dress up too much. ~she replies, before shaking his hand and fluttering back to the preening gaggle. She certainly doesn't fit the type; everybody needs a fixer~##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"...Alright." That quirks his brow, but he'll be doing research tonight at the apartment regardless.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*She stretches, combing her fingers deftly through her locks and capturing all but a few curly wisps of hair with a rubber band at the nap of her neck.* His name might actually be Vincent ...and he's a dancer, but the rest ... *she shakes her head* ...baloney##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		He watches Alicia return to the trampled garden patch again, toying with something in his head before responding to Guylian. "Maybe. Going to have to play this by ear." After all, it can't go as sideways is Omaha, can it?##
DamianStark:	##800000|		It's too simple... too clean. This has Chicago written all over it.##
Guylian:	##336633|		*Guylian snorts out a rather unladylike laugh.* I'd know about that ... No security detail on the inside but here they are concerned about his safety almost 24 hours before they tell everybody hes the bee's knees 'n yet we're supposed to arrive on site well after the breaking news.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		D seems lost in thought, but suddenly, he speaks. "You let me know how y'need me t'play it, and I'm yer man."##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		"Shall we take a walk." Kai says, taking a step towards the elevators. "Sounds like we have a lot to talk about."##

----

YaraST:	##666666|		((That's all for tonight from me... ~grin~ Next time, do you want to take it from their conversation? Or onto the next piece?))##
Guylian:	##336633|		Yes! *She scrambles to her feet, eager to get out of the confines of the building.*##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Bedtime )##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		((Next piece, we can do a little discussion offhours. Start next session on site. When do we want to play next?##
YaraST:	##666666|		((Okay, on-site when? "Tomorrow" for the show, or "tonight" for the dress rehearsal? ~tilts head~ After all, there's some suspicious folkses... Let me know what is decided!))##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Yup ... box office next time. I'm going to be at the Ren Festival until Sunday ..so, next Friday, I guess?)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Next Friday's fine.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Next friday is fine for us, up to Micha.]]##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Suspicious is our middle name *nods*)##
Guylian:	##336633|		(*big hugs* Very nice job tonight loved it!)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((*HUGS*))##
Guylian:	##336633|		*squish*)##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Was much fun, okay. So next friday, we'll figure out a time during the week, if not, assume same time?]]##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Works for me *nodnod*)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((Sure))##
YaraST:	##666666|		((~bounce~ Yay, see everybody soon!))##
DamianStark:	##800000|		((I may even be on time for this next one.))##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Hurray! )##
DamianStark:	##800000|		That was fun.##
Guylian:	##336633|		It was! Lots of fun visual moments##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Okies, thanks for playing everyone. This should be hilarious. Everyone have a good week and I'll catch you all around later!]]##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Cool. *brofist* Sorry for trampling yer rose garden.##
Guylian:	##336633|		I expect Kai to go around waving a stick "Get off my lawn!"##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[ LOL, I'm great with it, Kai's not. Trying to cultivate a careful relationship with the roses, and Damian comes in and pisses on the window dressings. Brilliant!]]##
Guylian:	##336633|		D only smelled the roses ... very close and personal##
DamianStark:	##800000|		Heh. That he did.##
DamianStark:	##800000|		A wallflower, Damian is not.##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		[[Anyways, gotta crash. Have a good night to you. ~completely unmanly hug~ Feels good to be back at it. ]]##
Guylian:	##336633|		(Good night, guys, love you loads!)##
DamianStark:	##800000|		No kidding!##
DamianStark:	##800000|		G'night, all. Sleep well.##
Guylian:	##336633|		Sentimental wusses, all of us *hugs, pecks, poof*##
DamianStark:	##800000|		*salutes and grins*##
Kai_Tukov	##110481|		Night bro!##

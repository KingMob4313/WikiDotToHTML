DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Finally. Thanks, Fred. Yer link worked. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Hello! ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Baaaaaaaaaaacon ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Had to use the weird link? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yep. The other one seems to time out. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Hello, C! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Bacon, eggs and French toast. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Mmmm, breakfast. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	How are things? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Work has me fighting with the urge to quit. It is becoming strong. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Hmm, that doesn't sound good. What's happening that's got you wanting to bounce? ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Everybody is here! *pounce* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Allo, allo! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Whee! ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Okay, so.... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So... Stuff! Yes. Stuff. There's stuff to do! ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Yay! ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~reviews log~ Okay. We last left our heroes at the theatre, where Vincent, who may be seeming more and more like a mirage as time goes on, has most rudely buggered off somewhere. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~reviews~ Okay, Trying to get on page. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Sorry to F, who asked me a question I missed.)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	It's all good, kinda brain smooshed. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian looks off into the distance, as though searching for the dancer's getaway vehicle, his eyes narrowed. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, question is, I suppose, what they choose to do next. I believe it would be most suitable to simply take the action back up where we stopped. Kai's out in the parking lot, having just seen the taxi leave, and Damian and Guylian are backstage (though with quick and easy access outside). ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Hmm, I think D just grabbed G's hand dragging her along to the exit?) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	It would serve them right if we bailed right here. The whole thing is a hose-job anyway. No pre-show meeting. No logistics. I am fuckin' sick of dealing with people with no sense of professionalism. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Wheee ...Tornado warning! ) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Woo hoo!)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Outside, of course. I had thought we'd managed to get outside before we bugged out last time.)) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	((Calling the whole thing off is certainly an option! ~grin~ So, all are outside.... Ready.... )) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	((Set... ~no tornado, no tornado...~)) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	((Mwahah, let's go.)) IC! ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(That's some messed up weather down here ...) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(*rubs hands gleefully*) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	IC: Taking up to a run, Kai strains against the darkness, using a blood talent instructed to him some years ago, trying to get the license plate of the one with Vincent inside. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian chews his lip in thought, his brow furrowed. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~what had been a lovely evening at a fun little frothy show, has turned into bit of a clusterfuck. Vincent's taxi pulls out towards the main boulevard; hooray for efficient traffic planners... He is able to get the plate, but there's plenty of people around; he'd best be very careful...~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Should go back and chew out Brent and Chaz ... *Guylian's perpetual soft purring voice is colored with the suppressed growl of annoyance.* ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Sorry, was switching locations and got a message from my sister about my dad.)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Everything alright?) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Other than the massive bashing I gave my arm, all good)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((They took one of the medical monitors off him and say they're sending him home soon)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D glances once at Guylian. "Nah. That might end up being a literal chewing, and they were just coverin' for their bro. The ones who need to get shredded like my mom's curtains're... well. You know." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((WOO!)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Keeping his eyes on the direction he is heading, he glances back to the door, hoping that Damian is on his way. There's about one way they can keep this from going completely in the shitter. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D shakes his head. "Not likely. Unless they're meeting him later... In which case, all we gotta do is follow 'em." ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	An that leotard better be smelly enough for your nose ... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D effects a sneeze. "First thing ol'Vince should do, is find a goddamn shower." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	A flurry of curse words. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian stands outside in the improbably thick grass with Guylian nearly wringing his hand off, staring off in the direction the taxi went. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~so, outside, a trio of frustrated and/or forlorn kindred... A departed taxi, and a party to get to later that evening~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(A sad sad sight) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian growls low in his chest. "Fuckin' Remington," he mutters. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	He pulls his phone out and crams a text into it to Damian. "Plate is 055 CDL" ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((sorry, was getting some details from the logs00 ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D reaches for his phone a moment later, mashing his fingers on the touch screen, sliding out menus from the cheerily glowing device. He scans it, nods once, and growls, "Bingo." He toggles the screen dark again and slides it back itno its case riding his belt. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Cutting his losses, takes up to a trot, heading for the rented BMW 325i. If you want something done.... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"All smells like shit to me. We do this job in a vacuum, this is what we get. We're not here to show this guy a good time. We're here to separate him from the herd-- spook him right into the Torries' waiting arms." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Let's go." He grins. "There a phone booth nearby?" ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~Damian may recall a few phones in the lobby; no so much demand for them, these days~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"I need to change... clothes." He notes the Beemer starting up and moving toward the exit. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	A parking garage should work, but too many of those have cameras... I should really find places downtown that are safe for shapeshifting. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai brings it around towards the front of the theater, hoping that his two clanmates are somewhat near by. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian scans the area, looking for a likely alleyway or... Or Kai being thoughtful enough to bring the car. Nice. "Guylian." He jerks his head in the direction of the car. "Get yer fine ass movin'." He regards the heels for a short moment. "Need me t'carry ya, cupcake?": ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai eases the German luxury car into the round up, and leans across the seat to push the front door open. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	You slay' me ... *Yep, definitely a snort, torn between amusement and incredulity. 1920s heels are much more sensible than their 21st century counterparts, and the diminutive Gangrel is as quick on foot as usual.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian gets the door for Guylian, as his long legs carry him to the car first. He then goes for the back seat. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai kicks it into gear, sing-songing to the other two. "Welcome to the disaster. I'm going to try to get us somewhat on track." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	His grin does not abate the entire time... and that serves a couple of purposes. No one who is smiling can possibly be planning anything nefarious, and playful people in a hurry are only in a hurry to get to somewhere else fun." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Nix the ")) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Not our disaster." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"It is to me. Fucking hell, I jacked this one up badly." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D settles back into the seat, chewing his lip again. "Not our fault. Any of us. Look to our fuckin' emplyers for where this clusterfuck started." ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*She slips onto the passenger seat and closes the door in one swift, fluid motion, buckling in. She catches her lower lip between her lips as if biting back words.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Think about it, Kai. No logistics to speak of. No pre-show meeting with the client. They ~wanted~ this guy to skate out." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Chances are, even if this was legit, not one of these Roses have ever done this shit before. Not a professional among them." He snorts. "Even Holt was more professional." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Leading the BWM out onto the main road out from the parking lot ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the cab was heading towards South Las Vegas Boulevard, which isn't the quickest way to the highway~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"He could be anywhere now." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Truth. Likely, he's gonna buy some clothes and get a room so he can shower and change." ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the dispatcher sounds like he's chewing gum or his lunch from the horrible smacking noises over the line~ Yeah... Uh-huh. Got the cab number? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D sinks lower into the seat, smirking to himself. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai heads for the highway, letting 'Nora' talk. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~he heaves a sigh, as if looking up a plate is the most tedious, tiresome act he's been asked to perform in at least the last five minutes~ Fiiine. Let me run it. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He sends blood to his tissues, diffusing it outward towardd his skin, then drawing it back, pulling flesh with it, changing it, his form shrinking into the floorboards, resolving into that of a northern Goshawk. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Fiance? Heh. As if poor Kai don't feel awkward enough... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the smacking continues over the line, with the occasional crunch. Must be lunch, then. There's chatter in the background; busy place late at night in Vegas~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Goddammit. The Iron Man 3 bus is leaving now. THey ask me: Hey, Chad. You wanna go see IM3 later? I say, yeah. They buy tickets and say Okay. We're going NOW.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Bastards.)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Awkward ain't quite the word for it, if he was still mortal he would be blushing. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Later, sure. TEN MINUTES later???)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Muh?) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	\((I know.)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Sounds like my friends)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((This is why I do things by myself.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	They. Are. Staring at me. ## 
____________________________________________ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*Flop* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Allo! ~offers beer~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~carries fireman style~ You gonna be okay? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*TAKES beer.* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~patpatpat... trails along~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yeah. I'll be fine. Rough week. Been really looking forward to this. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Oh. Guess where I am? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Hin: Had a little trouble getting in. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Hint: ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Berkans? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Nope. I am. At. Home. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I haz netz! ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	NETS! ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~does the dansss of nets~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	There comes a time in every man's life when he has to say (in a stupid accent) "Screw eet, yoo can doo eet!" ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	 ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	That is awesome. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. Fred and I would know that as "Cat Stance". I can tell his Kung Fu is strong; his style unstoppable. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And, he moustache you a question. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	He should keep his guard up. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	It could be air guitar, too. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Possibly! I have fondness for lolcats that I'm sheepish to admit. Heh. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~stage whisper~ C is getting me drunk to try to take advantage of me. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	What a coincidence. I'm getting myself drunk. Probably to take advantage of myself later. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Hey, you're hardly arguing. ~boofboof~ Besides, I had a whole bottle to myself last week. Just ask C how that turned out. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	I would have built up the whole "Hey, what's happening around this bonfire with the people with the devil masks?" if we'd had more time. Mwahah. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*SPLAT!* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D might have mistaken them for a much more populous incarnation of Kai's old pack. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Heeeey! Yat! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*picks up Micha and dusts her off* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... Yay. I mean "yay". ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yat? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Really? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Conjugate yer b'gack, sweetheart. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Longest talent show ever ... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... I blame my keyboard.... ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Sticky but sweet ...ha! ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Okies, everyone is here so..... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Woooow.... ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	so he quits? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*LOL* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	That makes no sense whatsoever ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Oh, he's going downstairs. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	It is too distracting up here, sez he. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... It may or may not have to do with the things I throw at him. Like cats. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*blinks* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I wonder why that could be.... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, he'll have minilappy in just a few, and be right back. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*wisely keeps his off-color observations to himself* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Grown wise with the years, eh? *elbows Chadster* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... That's it, rocks fall, everyone dies! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I will also be right back. Needed to make sure I could get on with my desktop. Gotta grab food at the store across the street. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	To both. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Cool! Acquire nourishment, and we'll ready to go when you're back. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Talk about clearing a room .... sheesh ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*adds new skill to list* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, talent show, huh? ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Rapt audience no matter how 'bad' an act was ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Awww, that gets to be some of the cute, though. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	and very very funny there was one outstanding 5th grade girl. She sang and, holy moly, in a few years, if she keeps that up. Just fantastic. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, what was the act you were there to see? ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... Oh dear... Did they get laughs in the right places? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Kewl. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Sorry about that, PC was acting up. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Oh yeah, they did *chortles* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	It's fine. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Hey, great timing! ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Welcome back I think it's time C and I go and powder our noses *nods* ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Oh... Okay? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Y'got yer friend, cupcake; don't forget yer purse. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~snerk~ We all comfy and settled? ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~slumps~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*Sets up to devour at least half a cow.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yep. I'm good. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	She's gonna use that purse to powder somebody's nose ...*thumbs at C* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Purse, with brick... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And five dots of potence. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	That'd definitely powder a nose ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Okay, last one before IC http://www.flickr.com/photos/peterscottnz/2531444191/ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And the mandibular processes, associated fossae and probably finish with the occipital plate. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Awwwww, fuzzy lollipop. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	It gets funnier the longer you look at it ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Accompanied by a fine, red and grey mist. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	It's no wonder alpacas bite and spit. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	They're pissed. Collectively, at that haircut. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, last time, someone was turning into a turkey, someone else was thanking dispatch, and someone else was driving. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	We're past the turkey thing. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	eally. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Really. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*grumble* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Someone stole my R. And my sweetroll. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	.... ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	We're missing a game log! ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Fiiine. Someone was shifting, someone else was thanking dispatch, and someone else was driving. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Oh right. D had reverted from hawk form, thus turning BACK into the turkey he normally is. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Ah, yes, was going to combine the bit from last time with tonight's, because it ended in the middle of things. I should get the bit at the buddhabar up, though, you're right. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Yep, D was going turkey, Kai was driving and G was sweet-talking dispatch into telling her where the cab was headed so they could meet up ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Buddha bar was really short tho' ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Right. D. Giving everyone in the car the bird. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Okay, so.... ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~damn wine~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~phone~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Hey, Michaela... I'll take that hug now... Y'know, now that I'm not at work. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Sorry, folks' email got hacked. Just got them sorted. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, in the car, bird, phone, driving... GO! IC: ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	IC: ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	IC ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~dispatch loudly smacks whatever it is in his mouth, sounding bored and cattle-stupid~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	and very very funny there was one outstanding 5th grade girl. She sang and, holy moly, in a few years, if she keeps that up. Just fantastic. ##

YaraST:  ##666666| 	Ah, yes, was going to combine the bit from last time with tonight's, because it ended in the middle of things. I should get the bit at the buddhabar up, though, you're right. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Yep, D was going turkey, Kai was driving and G was sweet-talking dispatch into telling her where the cab was headed so they could meet up ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Buddha bar was really short tho' ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Right. D. Giving everyone in the car the bird. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Okay, so.... ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~damn wine~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~phone~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Hey, Michaela... I'll take that hug now... Y'know, now that I'm not at work. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Sorry, folks' email got hacked. Just got them sorted. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	So, in the car, bird, phone, driving... GO! IC: ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	IC: ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	IC ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~dispatch loudly smacks whatever it is in his mouth, sounding bored and cattle-stupid~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*She waits patiently for an answer, watching Kai drive.* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	'Kay, 605 looks like it's outside of Paris right now. ~he says, around a mouthful of something unsavoury. The streets around them are busy with the streams of theatre-goers returning to their hotels on the strip~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Paris? Wow. They made good time, D jokes internally. He looks toward the open window. Okay. Playing to my strengths may not always be the best idea... Particularly considering I embarass myself in front of these people every time I take this particular form. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Can we catch up with him there? ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	He's waiting for a new fare at the stand. If ya hurry, yer probably gonna be in luck. He's number 8 in the row. ~he says, and hangs up~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Did that dude just say "yer?" That's my thing! Copyright infringement'r somethin'... Jrk. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	The car slows a bit, Kai completely confused to what Guylian is passing along, not having the conversation that was over the phone in his mind. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian preens in the floorboards of the backseat absently. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I may or may not be too comfortable as a tur-- hawk. He mentally beats his own face in for dredging up the memory of that annoying, invasive, absolutely adorable dog. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	We had a moment, to be sure. I miss him. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~it's a beautiful night... Clear, dry, not too warm... It'd be a great night to be out hunting, finding an easy meal, and not stuck in close quarters with two competitors for the local food supply, no matter how friendly they seem~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((evil!)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Heh ...*L*) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Dark eyes narrowing, he scans the streets, trying to remember where the taxi stand is in relation to where he is at, now catching the reference, heading for the faux tower. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"We're going to need someone to shake down the driver to see where he dropped off the runner." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	As always, his thoughts turn to poor Emily, with her indomitable spirit and will, and her dutiful, caring sister. His heart rends from the inside out, and the night air calls to him. He considers a moment, just flying out the window and gone, to be alone with his thoughts, to get his fill of blood for a change... to be free of labyrinthine, byzantine Toreador ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~easy enough to find the taxi stand, as it's on Paris Drive, in a roundabout just outside of Paris Las Vegas, with its dorky Eiffel Tower and its dorky montgolfiere~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	plots and tedious, draconic politics. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~just south of Flamingo, it's easy to get to off of South Las Vegas Boulevard... Damian might muse that while he heard news reports about little Emily, nothing much was said about where her cousin ended up, or the dog, for that matter. Poor things~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	If they show up here.... Nah. That's too goddamned far-fetched. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	But, still... If they do... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He makes up his mind to go shred a certain Malkavian in the windy city, just to put the whole thing to bed. She started this, after all. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Nothing really ridiculous had happened to him until she... Well, D admits to himself, nothing I didn't bring upon myself... Arren springs readily to mind... Like the fucking Great Old One rising out of the goddamn ocean, for the record. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And Holt. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And my fucking sire (fuck you, Torque!). ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D almost has a human-sized replay of being stuffed in a dryer hose as he regains his more or less original form. He crabbily scrambles out of the floorboards, righting himself in the seat. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((~grumbles~)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Welcome back) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Missed everything one line after my last post. ~sigh~ Anyways)) ##

Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Pulling to the curb, he puts the car in park. This has gone right to shit, hasn't it? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Mibbit, it seems, likes to smear itself with some kind of Crisco bullshit before kicking you in the taint.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Damian snorts. "This is bullshit." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Almost echoing Kai's thoughts... or more continuing them. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~one of the many gaudy casinos looms over them; this one out of some marketing nightmare where someone who has never been to Paris, let alone France, describes what they thing they would find, and then added tonnes of neon~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I am never going to get used to this acid trip version of a tweaker's Paris. What a gaudy piece of shit. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Nobody is shootin' at us yet .... *Guylian dips forward, pecking Kai's cheek briefly before sliding from her seat and out the car. The petite Gangrel casts a quick glance around trying to orientate herself in the hustle and bustle amidst starry-eyed tourists and then zooms in on the taxi stand.* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(3....2....1 .... waits for kai to implode) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	The idea is so absurdly funny to him in his head, Damian speaks it, too. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Not even the French here is authentic." ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~there are scads of cabs from various companies, but Ace cabs does have a stand. 605 is up to number 3 in the queue~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	But then, he thinks, I learned what little French I know from a guy named Torque. How authentic can THAT be? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D falls silent, allowing Kai his room to think and plan. this is his show, after all. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai instinctively rolls the shoulder away from Guylian, but a moment too late. Maybe Guylian is in on some elaborate joke of the roses. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"Damian, what's your take on this?" Kai asks, as Guylian shuts the door. "The last time I saw her, was before everything blew-the-fuck-up in Minneapolis..." ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*Guylian weaves her way through the crowd, sidestepping and evading bumbling tourists with her own brand of lazy grace before sidling up to cab 605.* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Gotta love the bromance between K and D) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"What," Damian asks dimly. He strugles to shift gears, Kai's abrupt, uncharacteristically off-job query throwing him. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Oh. "Oh, you mean Guylian?" ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Where ya goin'? ~asks the bored cabbie, the car smelling of old menthol and air freshener~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He blinks and tilts his head in a decidedly avian fashion as he ponders the question, and the bajillion directions that Kai could be (and usually is) coming from. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"I know you knew her, pretty intimately." He says, as direct as a right cross. "But after I ran into her, my shitty life in the twin cities caught fire and I couldn't deal with the heat. Worst part is, nothing happened that would embarrass anyone but a priest or me..." He spits out, watching her slide away like a quicksilver tear admidst the crowds. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D's eyebrows raise and he shakes his head, as if recovering from a nice, direct right cross. "Uh, yeah. Lincoln. Much more boring, conservative town than that." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Yer wonderin' what she's doin' here? Concerned she got sent by someone'r another t'send yer life into a flaming tailspin?" He stares into the rear view at Kai. "That 'bout sum it up?" ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Priceless .... just priceless *chortles*) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"What do you know about her?" Kai never glances to Damian, instead watching her. "I heard through the grapevines she's tight with a few blues, none of the out east roses, so I can't imagine what her angle could have be." He says. "Exactly, things aren't real stable here and I'm poking my head in a few places I shouldn't, wondering if she's a cruise missile. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Yeah," he muses quietly. "I was wonderin' th'same thing." ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(C - Fred's got my character sheet in case you need stats for rolling) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He shrugs. "The Blueblood angle fits; it was a snotty fuckin' CEO type of a blue who sent me to th'airport after 'er. She's pretty damn familiar with th'way they operate. I think she used t'work for th'mob... Irish, if I don't miss." ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Uh.... ~he stares blankly, his gum rolling out of his jaw~ Uh... Vincent...? ~he asks dully. Doesn't seem like he's being obstinate, just hasn't put all the pieces together. Guyli's pliable cabbie stares rather blankly at her, like a cursor on a blank screen~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Leaning forward a bit, to get a better view throught the tinted windshield, he has to push his hair back behind his ear. "Ain't caused much trouble for any mob, and I didn't have much of the blues on my radar, at least here in Vegas." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"Kai... Just like me, dude." he sighs and shakes his head. "You tripped HER radar." ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~his eyes drop heavily down to look at the screen, and he ponderously replies, as if fighting through a mental fog~ He got off here. Went inside... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"And-- agreed. I didn't really ping for the Blues until she arrived, really. Still don't know why they chose me, in particular." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	The idea slams against a seawall of denial, the concept outside of his consideration. "Did she derail you from something?" ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	...with....? *Guylian dips forward making sure to keep his eyes firmly locked in hers, watery blue drowning in amber pools.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D thinks about it. Had she? He considers where he was in his life at the time, focusing on making things easier for Joseph and Aida from afar. "Well, not really, but she was sure as hell distracting." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"I take it back." He reconsiders, chewing his lip. "Yeah," he says finally, his voice rough as a twenty-year smoker, "Yeah, she did. I never finished it either." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"With what you're walking around with..." He lets it hang, an airball missing the net by... ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Damian's U-turn draws him up short. "Oh? So it wasn't just you?" ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	He was alone. ~the weak-willed cabbie responds, meeting vacant to vibrant eyes~ He had a bag. ~he volunteers, the only thing besides Vincent that apparently went with him~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Whaaaaat? *L*) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He narrows his hawklike eyes in thought. "I think it was. We clicked. She wasn't anything like any of the dumb, corn-fed, shitheel motherfuckers I had to herd for th'damn Prince. I grabbed onto that like a stray lifeboat. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	" ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~his hand lifts up, pointing towards Paris' front doors, looking like the facade of Versailles, his arm brushing her hair as he points past her, a bit of drool starting to trail out of the corner of his mouth~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"After the sinking of th'goddamn Titanic. Threw DiCaprio overboard and rowed that shit to shore." Reconsidering again, he blanches. "Maybe that was a bad analogy." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He clarifies. "Drowning in idiots. She wasn't. Hung out." He soilently hopes Kai won't mistake his dumbing it down for himself as patronization. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((soilently? Greenbly?)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Mmmm, rum.)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(It's a British accent thing ... like Drusilla's "Spoike") ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"What did she draw you away from though?" ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Po' cabbie is getting brain moooooshed)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D falls silent, a pang of guilt stealing his words momentarily. "I..." he lets out the breath, then starts again. "I was tryin' t'make arrangements to get my brother safe." he chews his lip again, his face betraying the depth of his concern. "And Aida..." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Perspective, my dear, sweet, lovely, Gangrelmonster. Perspective." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"Were you able to?" ##

Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((I'd rather have a bottle in front of me...)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He sighs. "Never finished it. By the time I got back around to my plans, shit'd gone sideways, backwards, and every other way. My contact had gotten smeared all over Galveston, and my guy in Seattle went off to Europe or Asia minor or some shit." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Heh!)) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the cabbie absently wipes the corner of his mouth with his sleeve, taking the 20 on auto-pilot. The couple do claim the cab; the poor, mystified driver reached the front of the queue in the time it took Guyli to extract her answers~ ##

DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Though we can hope for full frontal nudity instead.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Which really is, in effect, the same thing. Lots of drooling. Inability to form a coherent sentence...)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(blaming, not laming) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Should have gone to Papau New Guinae. That's the fucking place to build it up. You get Papau, Risk is fuckin' yours. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"Here she comes, maybe she'll have some answers" ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((He knows the reality of it. It was his own stupidity.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"About th'job, sure. She's focused. Unlike me." ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*Hard to believe that this slip of a girl is the weapon of choice to derail many a Gangrel: 5'2, 120lbs soaking wet, her delicate frame a sliver of silver in the flickering lights of Vegas at night.

DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((That cabbie, BTW, is gonna remember her FOR-EVAH!)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Most likely he's going to be haunted by those eyes ... lose his job, end up drinking himself to death under a bridge *nods*) ##

YaraST:  ##666666| 	((Wasn't me!)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D's white-belt level plays at intrigue would probably have been seen as cute, had their blundering bulk gotten far enough to get noticed by the Prince and the Harpy. ##

Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((he's sleeping on my chest and headbutting everything)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D nods, blinking, grateful for the opportunity to NOT flog himself with a failure. For a change. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~it's quick access to the underground, but valets are handy, and for the Strip, it's worth the price~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He slides out of the rental, straightening his suit as he rises to his full height, towering over the diminutive Gangrel. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D makes a face. "Just got my sense of smell back. That shit's burned on my brain." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Don't matter how you dress 'em up. Sweaty balls are sweaty balls. Ugh. ##

DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D would never have a problem finding his way out of a casino. Some would say he followed the scent of sun-baked asphalt. He would call it ancient death left to dry in the sun. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*Guylian's eyes scan the crowd as she follows Damian, hoping to catch a glimpse of their elusive prey. The casino is a warren, their charge on the run.* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~tourists, tourists, tourists... There are a series of shops around the lobby, and huge planters filled with greenery, messing with sightlines and mocking the desert outside~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Once out of range of the stench of reconstituted millennia-old corpses, D scents for his prey. There would be gallons of sinus-blasting cologne and perfume to contend with, to separate Vincent's very honest scent from all the nasal-scouring odors. Antiseptic industrial cleaners, cigarette smoke, alcohol, ozone smell of electronic slots overheating from their ##

DamianStark:  ##800000| 	But I'm not judging, he thinks flippantly. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	There's something sexual underlying everything in this fucking town. He glances over to Guylian while trying the air, sampling the scent of arousal wafting from the young lady hanging on the every word of some high rolling forty-something with a suit worth more than Damian's car. Or Apartment. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the interior is meant to evoke Paris, with faux avenues, or French palaces, with gilt, crystal chandeliers. But the stone is only plaster, and the crystal's just glass, the gilding only paint. The reek of food repels from a buffet, paling in comparison to the appeal of the patrons~. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yep. Something vaguely arousing everywhere y'He smirks. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Fuck)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Waving off the greeter, he searches the caverous room with his gaze for the tall D-viking. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~a sliver of sweat, of chalk, of makeup of hairspray... It leads up an escalator, deeper into the labyrinth. It's been less than 45 minutes since they left the theatre; what could have happened?~ ##

DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D moves up the escalator, to the next casino floor where the people got richer and the decorations more garish yet. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	God, this place sucks. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He masks his next few sniffs of the air as a sneer at one of the more "historical" pieces from the Domain of Charlemagne... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the waitresses endlessly shlepping drinks to the tables would probably agree with Damian, carrying booze to ply the patrons to part with more cash. The thread of scent pools, leading off towards the craps tables~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	"He stopped here to look fer someone." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Or something... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He shifts his course unerringly,m as if he knows his way around. ##

Guylian:  ##208020| 	*She follows Damian like a shadow by his side, inwardly musing how she'd hoped for an evening of less hunting and retrieving and more ...well, fun. Instead, here she was, tiptoeing around two Gangrel, trying to locate an errant dancer and mindraping cab drivers. * ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~a waitress offers the trio martini glasses, mumbling something about the night's special~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Now this is exactly what I had had in mind for tonight. Some Torries in town need t'have their curtains shredded... and maybe their favorite dress-- preferably while they wear them. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~as if trying to emulate a scene out of a Bond flick, people crowd around a table as someone shoots dice.

His wingman nearly swallows them~ ##

YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the scent lingers, tendrils curling around the table, wrapping around the croupier~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the players, however, seem to have arrived later, pushing the scent away from their end~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D gives the waitress a lopsided grin. "Thanks," he murmurs at her, taking the glass. He looks at it. Shaken, not stirred. With bad Vermouth. Of course ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the trio don't attract much attention; some people watchers, glances from security... No scrutiny their way over that given generally~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Bond. James Bond. He frowns at the glass, his mind immediately dropping a memory of a steel plate and a plasma cytter on him like... well, that doesn't NEED an analogy, does it? ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*Guylian chooses to ignore the offer, waving it off with a polite smile, still searching the faces of the crowd for that one face. She's briefly distracted when Kai joins them, but since he's not trying to bite her head off for the little liberty she took earlier in the car, she resumes her scanning the crowd for the dancer that got away.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((cutter. *facepalm*)) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	No answer from Damian, Kai circles out wider, looking over the patrons gathered here. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D slowly circles the scent, busying his eyes and the imaginations of others by drawing them up the legs of a party girl and her gaggle of friends. The idle part of his mind took shots as to which of them was actually wearing panties under their skirts... belts? ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~no evident sign of him yet... Damian can smell the trace of their quarry, leading away, towards another escalator; Kai doesn't note him around the tables, though the banks of slot machines are hard to scan. Someone waves some chips at Guylian, laughing raucously with some friends, wearing a shirt with a ball and chain on it~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D stalks languidly toward the escalator, giving a small grin to the poor doomed soon-to-be ex-bachelor. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*Oh, the fun that could be had if it weren't for tonight's order of business. Guylian slinks after Damian, keeping her eyes and ears open, just in case. Another escalator.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	His last hurrah might turn a bit ugly if he gets her attention, he thinks, if she's too hungry. He could very well happen in Vegas... and no one would ever find the body. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Damn! redact after ... please.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	... and while he may not stay in Vegas, no one would ever find the body. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D smiles darkly at that one. Need to find out if Antonio had used that threat before. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	He looks to the taunters for a moment, but sees that Damian has it handled. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the scent gets fresher as they rise up over the crowd, arriving at a small, poorly-populated bar centred around a Grecian-style rotunda, with little fussy, filigree wrought-iron railings, the whole having a view of the casino floor~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Don't wanna scam the Princes threats, good as that one was... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	((http://www.parislasvegas.com/things-to-do/le-central.html#.UZbSdspXqOE)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Ain't that just fuckin' quaint? I think I may have thrown up a little in my mouth. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the scent is strong and recent, and Kai might well recognize a dull grey sweatshirt, its hood pulled up over a hunched-shouldered occupant of one of the white pleather chairs~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((Wow, do they all use HD photos? That super high contrast look?)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(So cute! *L*) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai points at his eyes with an index and middle finger, then at the hoodied one, looking purposefully to the other two. He takes point. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the clouds and sunny blue "sky" overhead may feel somewhat unfamiliar, or like a kick in the teeth. Rather looks like that's what someone might have done to Vincent, from his dejected pose, his dancer's body great at projecting emotion~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D screws down his courage and dives into Cutesie-Little-Bistro-Land. The painted sky on the ceiling, cheery, with it's own happy little clouds, drilled a hole into D's resolve, an unreasoning fear of the sun and all its lethal beauty. The apartment buildings and their deep shadows loomed in his mind, his first real brush with sunlight causing the beast to ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	churn and writhe in the pit within him. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	If Bob Ross is here.... I'm running. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Kai takes a place at the bar, looking to Vincent to try to get confirmation. The last thing they need is for a clothing swap. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D slows as he sights his prey, and comes to a stop in defiance of the beast leaping at the end of the chase the dancer represents. The Beast chokes and flips itself off its feet at the end of the chain of will Damian put him on in preparation for this moment. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~from what Kai can tell, it's the guy. He gets a clear look as Vincent knocks back a shot of something clear, his closed eyes outlined starkly in black kohl, stage makeup still in place there~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the bartender looks up from the endless chores of prepping and mixing, toweling off the wood as he glances at the newcomers, ready to take their orders~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D glances around the room, gawking like a tourist, but keeping the quarry in his peripheral. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"Vincent, if you just wanted to drink before the after party and hit a few tables up, it could have been arranged." Kai begins in a light tone, nodding to Guylian to hopefully back him up with a soft touch. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(*chortles*) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~Vincent blinks at Kai, both trying to place him, and focus, it seems. His makeup is a bit smudged; Kai might note some tell-tale smudges on his sleeve~ I... Seb told me to go... That I shouldn't go anywhere with anyone... ~his voice drops to a hoarse whisper. Damian's skills aren't necessary to pick out the hint of vodka~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~some of the dancers backstage, they'd mentioned a Seb... Looks like he might know something the rest of the cast didn't~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the other drinks at the bar seem engrossed in watching the drama on the floor, even if they can't make out the cards. Damian doesn't note anyone paying them much mind, boring as they are, just talking quietly or standing around~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	And now the phrase, "We'll always have Paris" seems somehow more bleak... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~Guylian's kind gesture causes his chin to wobble and his eyes to fill up (not for the first time, from their redness) but he doesn't lose it, though he quickly presses her offering to his eyes~ S-sorry... Thank you. God, I'm a mess... ~he mutters into his empty shot glass~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~were the Roses playing it straight? The guy's got something on his mind. Maybe he needed to get away from the theatre quickly...~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He looks around, turning to get a bird's eye of the casino floor, the first time he's taken a chance to see if the pranksters who'd put them on this hose job had sent a tail to snicker at them from somewhere near while the others did so from afar. His mind brings up an image of hissing, offended Toreador, and he smiles a little grimly. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~if there's a tail, Damian can't see it... they seem to be quite confident in their delegates, or at least, aren't making it obvious to the contrary~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Sebastian, most likely. Will have to check that out fully, later. "Looks like you've had a rough night, anything we can do to help? We're supposed to show you the sights before the party." ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	A sudden thought changed his parameters. He looks more for those who watch Vincent, rather than the errant trio of Gangrel, sliding over to the rail to be out of the way and nonchalant. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*She waves the bartender, getting Vince a water. As dehydrated as the dancer must be after the show he'd need more than a shot of vodka or two.* ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	He nods to Damian subtly, to let him know to keep up the watch out. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Likely they're just sitting in the damn security booth somewhere. Judas Priest queues up in his head, Halford screaming out ablutions of Big-Brother style voyeurism. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~the viking at the rail gets a few glances upwards as his shadow stretches over the tables, but he seems to be dismissed after a moment~ Were you sent to hurt me? ~he asks, watching the bartender amble off to get the water Guyli sent him for~ Seb was so worried coming to town. ~he hiccups; the alcohol must have hit him hard~ Said it's all bad people here. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D gives kai no indication that he saw, but does as he's silently bidden anyway. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. It's a bad town, he murmurs in his own head, his inner Bogart perhaps a bit better than his impression of the noir star. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Jesus Christ on a crutch. Noir. voyeurism... Well, when in Paris... ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He briefly considers jumping over the rail to bash his own head in on the gambling floor below. Only the fact he did not enunciate any of that bullshit was all that stayed his hand. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Man, I need to find a Brujah or a Nos to get into a fight with. I really need my ass kicked for even thinking that fucking tripe. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	"No, just to deliver you to the afterparty after showing you around." He gives a small light laugh. "That's all." ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Oh... What about the bus station? Show me that? ~he asks~ ... No, doesn't matter. It's all gone anyway... ~he takes a deep breath, his spine straightening as the bartender sets ice water in front of the three~ What kind of people are going to be at this party? Rich people? ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Maybe you would like to call Seb? And he could tag along if that would make you feel better? *There's a nagging little thought stealing itself into Guylian's mind.* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*She's sorely tempted to feed him as much Vodka as she could possibly cram into the lithe dancer before he passed out. Just to keep him from that party. She looks up, trying to catch Kai's gaze, hoping he'd get the idea of her growing unease.* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	D fishes into the pocket of his duster and taps out a clove from its crimson and black pack. The smells in here have got to go... He clacks open his lighter and lights it. Letting the smoke drift through his lips and inhaling it through his nose, he burns his sinuses with the cloying, strong smoke. His neck twitches as his nose screamks once before going ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	blessedly silent. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	He shakes his head at Guylian. "Standard 'entertain patron of the arts' type of shindig. Smile, make brief conversation. The usual." ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	((rapidly approaching pumpkin time)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((That it is)) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Meeeh) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	((Yer a fuckin' beast.)) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	No... Seb's going to be angry. ~he says resignedly, the drunkenness still there, but he's tamping it down out of sheer force of will~ Let's go. Let's just get out of here and... And stuff. ~he seems to be considering Kai's comment, mentally calculating something through the haze of vodka~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... Who are you, anyway? ~he asks, pausing~ ((And going to stop it there... Heh.)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*bouncybouncy* ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(Moo-oom, only 5 more minutes) ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(*L*) ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Heh, the trio has run him down. Got plans now to tie this all together. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(G has second thoughts about delivering him to the party tho' ) ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	((I figure there's about 2 in-game hours before the time Alicia said to bring him by. ~nod~)) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Definitely. D may just offe rto stay on as his bodyguard, protect him from the people who hired him for this, and earn a few more hisses. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	More peeing on rosebushes? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yep. They came and peed on his yard. It's only fair. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Very nice, tight playing tonight ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Agreed! ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	I'll get the log up sooner than the last time. ~chuckle~ Let me know when we're playing next week. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	(heh ....so what's with Damian randomly changing into bird form? Is that a tick he's developing? ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	I'll keep people informed. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	He was planning to find the guy in his own way. Too used to working on his own. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I'm good for next Friday. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I think... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Probably a lot more room back for a guy his size. ~L~ ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Back there, rather. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yep. He realized how ridiculous he was. Plus, like he considered, he always embarrasses himself with other people around. The Tremere ghoul's house was the last time he was at all effective in front of another Kindred in Vegas. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	In bird form, at any rate. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I've been in the back seat of a midsize Mercedes. I'd already eaten lunch, so eating my knees wasn't as satisfying as it could have been. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Sometimes it pays to be fun-sized! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	You'd know... ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~snerk~ ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	A-yep ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*grin* ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	~innocent whistle~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	*peer* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	In my experience, Tyler, when someone uses the term 'innocent' in regards to themselves, they are anything but... ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Pot, meet kettle ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~cackle~ ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Heh. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Oh! Chris Terbush says hello. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	*cricket chirp* ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Played Caleb Knight. Did his own thing, but Fred, we were at his house when you were in Wichita. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Completely. Anyways, got a long weekend. Oh! How is Chris doing? ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	You met him too, Micha. Big, goofy bastard. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	I do remember the name Caleb Knight tho'... just the family name didn't ring a bell ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Has two kids (girls) and a wife. Works a Gangrel ghoul's job. Greyhound bus station. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Congrats to him! Glad he's doing well. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Heh! All grown up ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I miss the guy. If you guys are amenable, he'd like to watch the game; maybe read the logs.' ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I wouldn't say he's all grown up. Heh. Just an older version of a 12 year old. *L* ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	... I don't know that I ever met him in game... ~think~ ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Well, reading our records seems fine. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	May want to run him some solo first, get him up to speed. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	~nods~ I don't much mind people reading the logs. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Oh, btw: the Marget Weis productions Marvel game is damn good. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	That'd be perfect. He doesn't get to do a lot outside the RP he and his Wife do... (That sounded perhaps a little bad.) ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	I'll check that out. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Gutter alert, gutter alert ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Oh! We found my house! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Yay! ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	Hmmrr? ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Aaaanyways, you guys have a nice weekend. We have home improvements to do. ## 
Guylian:  ##208020| 	We really do manage to hold it together until midnight. after midnight it all starts to fall apart and making no sense. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	We've improved. We used to NEVER make sense. ## 
YaraST:  ##666666| 	Urg... Right, painting and stuff. ... ~sighs~ Heh. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	Chad lives in the gutter, with his mind. ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	At least I've found it, and it's happy there. ## 
Kai_Tukov:  ##110481| 	lates! ## 
DamianStark:  ##800000| 	Night all... ##
